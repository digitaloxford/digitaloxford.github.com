# Digital Oxford

Digital Oxford is a Tech and Design community for jobs and events in Oxford. 

## Running digital oxford locally

This is a [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)/[github pages](https://pages.github.com/) site.

You can run this site locally with jekyll - there are some detailed instructions on [github help](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages), or just enter the commands below.

```bash
# install bundler globally
gem install bundler

# install jekyll (might take a while)
bundle install

# get jekyll to generate and serve the site
bundle exec jekyll server --watch
```

### OSX point and click version

1. make sure you have an up to date `ruby` and `bundler` installed on your computer (if you don't know/care what those are, find someone who does - you'll only need to do this once).

2. click ":rocket:.command" - this will open a terminal window running the server, and a web browser pointing at the site.

3. (once you're done) - close the terminal window.
