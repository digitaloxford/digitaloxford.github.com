title: Oxford Startups September Meetup
date: 25.09.2014
time: 6:00pm - 9:00pm
link: http://attending.io/events/dopm
detail: It will be taking place as usual in the Jam Factory but starting a little earlier and running from 6-9pm. This meetup will be a collaboration (or mashup) with the Future Business Entrepreneurs Drinks, which means we'll get a chance to expand our network further and should have a large crowd. They'll also kindly be providing some free drinks.
