detail: As web designers, there are lessons we can learn and insights we can gain from stepping outside of the discipline and approaching our design process from a different angle. Over the past year or so Luke has been looking into the processes of other areas of design, picking them apart and drawing parallels to the work of web designers, in the hope that he'll be able to improve his working process.
