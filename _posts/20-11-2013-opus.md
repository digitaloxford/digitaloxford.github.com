title: Transmedia publishing in a Brave New World
date: 20.11.2013
time: 6:30-9:00pm
link: http://www.opusnet.co.uk/events/forthcoming-events/transmedia
detail: This event moves away from the more traditional topics that OPuS normally deals in and looks at other parts of the creative industries that are also publishing.  Bringing together speakers from places where some of the most interesting creative work is being done, we have linked the evening together with a look at the power of story.
