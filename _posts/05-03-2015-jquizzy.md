detail: Fast becoming a jQuery UK institution, join us for jQuizzy. Team up with other delegates to pit your wits against our fiendishly difficult pub quiz questions. Expect general knowledge with a geeky twist. If youâ€™re coming to jQuery UK alone and hoping to make a few friends before conference day, this is designed for you!
