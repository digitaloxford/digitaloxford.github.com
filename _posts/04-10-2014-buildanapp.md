title: Build an Android app in an afternoon
date: 04.10.2014
time: 12pm - 3pm
link: http://www.meetup.com/app-afternoon/events/203069322/
detail: This is for the PC and Mac users out there. Android apps can be developed on PCs and Macs, so it's free for all. The process is similar to iOS, however there are enough fundament differences between the two so I have decided to run a separate event.
