detail: We are product designers looking for freelance product interaction support for a consumer medical product that we are currently designing. The project is a bit different to standard web work as the display technology is quite limiting (monochrome dot matrix LCD) and the user interacts with the product via physical controls! We estimate this is between 4 to 6 weeks worth of work but it will be spread out over a number of phases. We would be very interested to hear from anyone who has availability starting from around mid-November.
