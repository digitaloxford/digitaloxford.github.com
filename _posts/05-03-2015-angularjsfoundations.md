detail: AngularJS is a one of the most popular MVC frameworks in building a front-end application, and the best place to start learning about it is at the beginning. In this class weâ€™ll lay the groundwork for learning AngularJS by introducing scope for data-binding, controllers for MVC on the client, events, filters to format output, directives to extend the HTML vocabulary, modules to group code, services to provide application-wide functionality, and routes to enable Single Page Applications (SPA).
