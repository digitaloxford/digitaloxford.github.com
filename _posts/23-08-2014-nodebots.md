detail: SusHack helps developers get together to create solutions to sustainability problems using their skills in development and lots of coffee. The aim of the hack day isn't to deliver any polished software, but to rapidly take something from an idea through to a working/demonstrable piece of software. SusHack is completely free to attend. We've got the space, food/refreshments and WiFi, all you need to bring is yourself and your laptop.
